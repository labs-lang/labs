# Original description:
# This protocol takes a majority vote. More precisely, it (attempts to) compute
# whether there are initially more agents in state Y than N. The protocol has
# only 3 states, but does not always converge to the correct consensus.
# Described in Dana Angluin, James Aspnes and David Eisenstat. A Simple
# Population Protocol for Fast Robust Approximate Majority. Distributed
# Computing, vol. 21, issue 2, pp. 87â€“102, 2008.

# 0 = N, 1 = Y, 2 = b
